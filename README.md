# ChainDNS
ChainDNS is revolutionizing the Internet's Domain Name System by leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized, secure, and resilient DNS platform. Unlike traditional DNS systems that are vulnerable to cyberattacks and censorship, ChainDNS offers unparalleled security, privacy, and transparency. By removing single points of failure, we're protecting businesses and users from DNS spoofing and DDoS attacks, while ensuring data privacy and trust. With ChainDNS, we're not just upgrading DNS infrastructureâ€”we're future-proofing it for the digital age.

- Better than Secure, without the hassle of DNSSEC 
- Highly Available due to global decentralization
- Censorship-Resistant
- Privacy-enhanced for data-at-rest and data-in-motion 

ChainDNS is NOT a replacement for the existing DNS system.  The ChainDNS system has been designed to directly interoperate with standard DNS in terms of protocols, governance, administration and operation.  Caching servers can query a ChainDNS Authority Server in the same way they query DNS nameservers like Knot, BIND, NSD, or PowerDNS.   Additionally, local DNS resolvers can be installed in  your computer or mobile device for direct protected blockchain access.
